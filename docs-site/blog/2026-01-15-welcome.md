## What is Batchivo?

Batchivo started as an extensive spreadsheet for tracking personal 3D printing projects. As the complexity grew, we realized there had to be a better way. Now it's evolved into a full-featured business management system that the community can benefit from.

## Key Features

- **Inventory Management**: Track filament spools, materials, and suppliers
- **Product Catalog**: Define products with bills of materials and automatic costing
- **Production Runs**: Track print jobs with material usage and quality metrics
- **Self-Hosted**: Your data stays on your infrastructure

# Introduction

**Batchivo** is a comprehensive, self-hosted platform for managing 3D printing businesses. From filament inventory tracking to multi-marketplace pricing strategies, Batchivo helps you run your 3D printing operation professionally and profitably.

## Why Batchivo?

**Born from need**: Started as an extensive spreadsheet for tracking personal 3D printing projects, evolved into a full-featured business management system that the community can benefit from.
